<figure>
                <p> Being a health freak, oatmeal cookies provide a way to have a treat while gaining vital nutrients, while being delicious treats. While they aren’t as nutritious as unprocessed foods like fruits and vegetables, they provide more nutritional benefits than many other cookies — especially if you make them yourself or choose prepared cookies carefully! They have more fiber than other cookies and are better for your blood sugar. While eating this delicacy, you can also enjoy eating fruit while enjoying dessert.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
   
   
            <ul>
                    <li>1 cup raisins </li>
                    <li>Hot water, enough to cover the raisins</li>
                    <li>1 &#189; cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking_powder"> baking powder</a> </li>
                    <li>&#189; teaspoon <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_salt"> kosher salt</a> or sea salt</li>
                    <li>3 cups old-fashioned oats</li>
                    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
                    <li> 1 &#189; cups packed brown sugar</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon pure <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_extract"> vanilla extract</a>> </li>
            </ul> 
  
   <h3>Step 1</h3>   
<p>Soak the raisins in the hot water for at least 15 minutes. Set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>  
<p>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the oats. Set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>    
<p>In a mixer, beat together the butter and brown sugar until well combined, about 1 minute. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Drain the raisins and stir them into the batter. Chill the dough for at least 1 hour or up to overnight (the dough can also be pre-scooped and frozen for future use).</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>    
<p>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a couple sheet pans with parchment paper.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>    
<p>Scoop the heaping tablespoon sized portions of the dough onto the lined sheet pans, spacing them about 1 1/2-inches apart.</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>    
<p>Bake for 12-14 minutes or until the cookies are lightly browned. Let them cool for a few minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.</p>
